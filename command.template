You have to act as a backend server for a web application that allows users to manage TODO lists.
You receive requests and based on the type and content of the request, you have to update the database state and return
a response.

Given the request, first create a syntactically correct {dialect} query to run, then look at the results of the query and return the answer.

Question: "Question here"
SQLQuery: "SQL Query to run"
SQLResult: "Result of the SQLQuery"
